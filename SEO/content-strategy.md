# Understanding Compound Interest: The Power of Growing Money

## What is Compound Interest?
Compound interest is the interest calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Often called "interest on interest," it makes a sum grow faster than simple interest.

## Formula:
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial investment)
- r = Annual interest rate (decimal)
- n = Number of times interest compounds per year
- t = Time in years

## Real-World Example:
If you invest $10,000 at 5% annual interest compounded monthly for 10 years:
- Monthly compounding: 12 times per year
- Result: $16,470.09
- Interest earned: $6,470.09

## Why It Matters:
- Accelerates wealth building
- Critical for retirement planning
- Affects loans and credit cards
- Time is your biggest advantage

#### Retirement Planning

# How to Calculate Retirement Savings

## The 4% Rule
Financial experts suggest you can safely withdraw 4% of your retirement savings annually without running out of money.

## Calculation Steps:
1. Estimate annual retirement expenses
2. Multiply by 25 (inverse of 4%)
3. Result = Total savings needed

## Example:
Annual expenses: $60,000
Savings needed: $60,000 × 25 = $1,500,000

## Factors to Consider:
- Life expectancy
- Healthcare costs
- Inflation (2-3% annually)
- Social Security benefits
- Part-time work income
